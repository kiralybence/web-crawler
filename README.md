# Web Crawler

Grab all the links you can find. That's it.

## Warning
The crawler sends a **lot** of requests and you might get rate limited (or worse, IP blacklisted). I advise you not to crawl websites you don't want to get kicked from.

## Setup

- Install npm packages
```sh
npm install
```

- Run the script
```sh
node index.js <url>
```
